# 0x01. Git
## Description
Welcome to the 0x01. Git project! Here, you will learn the basics of source code management, Git, GitHub and how to work with Git and GitHub.

## Learning Objectives
* Understanding source code management
* Understanding Git and how it works
* Understanding the difference between Git and GitHub
* Creating a repository
* Understanding what a README file is and how to write a good one
* Committing, pushing and pulling code updates
* Creating branches and merging them
* Working as a collaborator on a project
* Understanding which files should and shouldn't appear in your repo

## Requirements
* A README.md file at the root of the alx-pre_course repo, containing a description of the repository
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x01-git), describing what this project is about
* Use the command line instead of GitHub's web UI for the exercise (except for operations that can not possibly be done any other way than through the web UI)
* Answer files should only contain the command and nothing else

## Basic Usage
At the end of this project you should be able to perform the following commands:

``` shell
$ git clone <repo>
$ touch test
$ git add test
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git push origin main
```

## Plagiarism Warning
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks on your own to meet the learning objectives. Plagiarism of any form is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
